# Recommended Test Actions

## Immediate Testing Steps

1. **Start with superman account** (highest privileges) to understand full system capabilities
2. **Test each role systematically** using the checklist above
3. **Document all accessible features** for each role
4. **Test security boundaries** by attempting unauthorized actions
5. **Verify audit logging** for all privileged operations

## Manual Testing Commands

```bash
# Run the testing script
./test-admin-privileges.sh

# Check current users and roles (from database)
docker exec bahmni-lite-openmrsdb-1 mysql -u root -p$(grep MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD .env | cut -d'=' -f2) openmrs -e "SELECT u.username, r.role FROM users u JOIN user_role ur ON u.user_id = ur.user_id JOIN role r ON ur.role = r.role WHERE u.retired = 0;"

# Check high-risk privileges
docker exec bahmni-lite-openmrsdb-1 mysql -u root -p$(grep MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD .env | cut -d'=' -f2) openmrs -e "SELECT r.role, p.privilege FROM role r JOIN role_privilege rp ON r.role = rp.role JOIN privilege p ON rp.privilege = p.privilege WHERE p.privilege IN ('Manage Users', 'SQL Level Access', 'Manage Global Properties', 'Manage Modules');"
```

## Browser Testing Checklist

For each user account, test these URLs and document access:

1. **http://localhost/bahmni/home/** - Main dashboard
2. **http://localhost/bahmni/registration/** - Patient registration
3. **http://localhost/bahmni/clinical/** - Clinical operations
4. **http://localhost/bahmni/admin/** - Administrative functions
5. **http://localhost/openmrs/admin/** - OpenMRS administration
6. **http://localhost/bahmni/reports/** - Reports module
7. **http://localhost/implementer-interface/** - System configuration
